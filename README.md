# Hand-gesture-game-controller
A computer vision-based project that uses hand gestures to control games or trigger specific actions. Built using Python, OpenCV, and MediaPipe, this system detects hand movements via a webcam and translates them into keyboard inputs using PyAutoGUI â€” enabling touchless, intuitive interaction with PC games or applications.
